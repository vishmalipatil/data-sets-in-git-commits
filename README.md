#### Storing data sets in git commits instead of repo to have unlimited storage.

>Have you ever faced problem while storing raw data sets incloud and confused about which DB, which storage?

Here is the simple solution :rocket:

As soon as you have raw data, create a file and commit to your git repo. 
And whenever you get more and more data sets, keep commiting that data to same file. That way, your reposotory size won't be increased but you will almost have unlimited storage space to keep this **unorganised data**.
